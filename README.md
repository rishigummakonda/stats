- Linear Regression
- Classification
- Resampling Methods
- Linear Model Selection and Regularization
- Non-linear Modeling
- Tree-based Methods
- Support Vector Machines
- Unsupervised Learning

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:.

- **Datasets/**: Contains datasets used throughout the course.
- **Mini_Projects/**: Personalized mini projects to showcase skills learned in each chapter and lab.

## Personalized Mini Projects

In the **Mini_Projects/** directory, you will find personalized mini projects designed to demonstrate the skills and concepts learned in each chapter and lab. These projects serve as practical applications of the theoretical knowledge gained throughout the course. Each mini project is crafted to reflect my understanding and mastery of the course material, providing concrete examples of how statistical learning techniques can be applied using Python, particularly in the realm of public policy.
